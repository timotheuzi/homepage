- **Stealth System**: Hide and perform backstab attacks with bonus damage.
- **Drug & Addiction**: Temporary stat boosts with dependency risk and withdrawal damage.

## MUD Client Setup

Darkness BBS supports traditional MUD clients like Mudlet, MUSHclient, and any standard Telnet client.

### Prerequisites

1. **Create your character** using the web interface first (character creation is web-only)
2. **Start the MUD server**: `python manage.py start_mud_server`
3. **Note the connection details**: By default, the server listens on port 4000

### Connecting with a MUD Client

#### Mudlet

1. Open Mudlet
2. Click **"Connect"** → **"Connect to..."**
3. Enter your server details:
   - **Host**: `localhost` (or your server's IP address)
   - **Port**: `4000`
   - **Name**: `Darkness BBS`
4. **Important**: Uncheck the **"Use SSL/TLS"** option (the server uses plain Telnet, not encrypted)
5. Click **"Connect"**
6. Log in with your handle and password when prompted

**Optional Mudlet Profile Setup:**
- Enable **ANSI Colors** in Settings → General
- Set **Command Separator** to `;` if you want to chain commands
- Create aliases for common commands (e.g., `l` for `look`)

#### MUSHclient

1. Open MUSHclient
2. Click **"File"** → **"Connect"**
3. Enter connection details:
   - **Host**: `localhost` (or your server's IP)
   - **Port**: `4000`
4. Click **"OK"**
5. Log in with your handle and password

#### Generic Telnet Client

From a terminal/command prompt:
```bash
telnet localhost 4000
```

Or using netcat:
```bash
nc localhost 4000
```

### MUD Client Configuration Tips

#### Recommended Settings

- **Encoding**: UTF-8 or ASCII
- **Line Endings**: CRLF (\r\n)
- **Terminal Type**: ANSI or VT100
- **Character Set**: ISO 8859-1 or UTF-8
- **Echo**: Local (client-side echo)

#### Mudlet-Specific Tips

1. **Enable ANSI Colors**: Settings → General → Check "Use ANSI colors"
2. **Set Prompt**: The game sends a status line after each command showing:
   ```
   HP:100/100|MA:20/20|LV:1|CR:25|[Neutral]
   ```
3. **Create Aliases** (optional):
   ```
   l = look
   n = north
   s = south
   e = east
   w = west
   i = inventory
   st = status
   ```

#### MUSHclient-Specific Tips

1. **Enable ANSI**: File → World Properties → General → Check "Use ANSI colors"
2. **Set Command Separator**: Use `;` to chain commands (e.g., `n;look`)
3. **Create Triggers** (optional):
   - Trigger on: `HP:(\d+)/(\d+)` to track health
   - Trigger on: `\[(.*?)\]` to track karma alignment

### Telnet Protocol Notes

- The server uses standard Telnet protocol (port 23 by default, but configurable)
- ANSI escape codes are used for screen clearing and text formatting
- Line endings are CRLF (\r\n)
- The server does not require Telnet option negotiation (works with basic clients)
- Character creation must be done via the web interface

### Troubleshooting

**Can't connect:**
- Ensure the MUD server is running: `python manage.py start_mud_server`
- Check firewall settings allow port 4000
- Verify the server is listening: `netstat -an | grep 4000`

**Garbled text:**
- Enable ANSI colors in your client
- Check encoding settings (use UTF-8 or ASCII)
- Ensure line endings are set to CRLF

**Commands not working:**
- Make sure you're logged in (you should see a room description)
- Check that you're typing commands in lowercase (most commands are case-insensitive)
- Use `HELP` or `?` to see available commands

**Disconnections:**
- The server has a 20-minute inactivity timeout
- Use `EXIT` to log out cleanly
- If disconnected unexpectedly, simply reconnect and log in again

### Running Both Web and MUD Simultaneously

You can run both the web interface and MUD server at the same time:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Django web server
python manage.py runserver

# Terminal 2: Start MUD server
python manage.py start_mud_server
```

Players can use either interface interchangeably - they share the same game state and database.

### PythonAnywhere Deployment

On PythonAnywhere, you can run both the web interface and MUD server:

**Web Interface:**
- Configured via the PythonAnywhere "Web" tab
- Runs on standard ports (80/443)
- Uses WSGI configuration

**MUD Telnet Server:**
- Run as an "Always-On Task" in the PythonAnywhere dashboard
- Default port: 4000
- You can customize the port with: `python manage.py start_mud_server --port 5000`
- **Important**: On PythonAnywhere free accounts, you can only run the web app. The MUD server requires a paid account to run as an always-on task.
- On paid accounts, configure the always-on task to run: `python manage.py start_mud_server --port 4000`

**Firewall/Port Configuration:**
- PythonAnywhere allows outbound connections on any port
- For inbound MUD connections, use a port like 4000, 5000, or 8000
- Players connect to: `yourusername.pythonanywhere.com:4000`

**Example PythonAnywhere Setup:**
1. Deploy web app via the "Web" tab (standard Django setup)
2. Go to "Tasks" tab → "Always-On Tasks"
3. Add command: `python manage.py start_mud_server --port 4000 --settings=darkness_django.settings.production`
4. Players can now connect via MUD client to `yourusername.pythonanywhere.com:4000`

### Security Notes

- The MUD server does not use encryption (standard Telnet)
- For production deployments, consider using SSH tunneling or a VPN
- Passwords are transmitted in plain text over Telnet
- Use strong passwords for your account
- The web interface uses HTTPS when properly configured
